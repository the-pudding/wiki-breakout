Levels were assigned to based on monthly averages. There were eight levels (like Karate belts): (1) 50, (2) 100, (3) 200, (4) 500, (5) 1,000, (6) 2,000, (7) 5,000, and (8) 10,000, pageviews. If someone hit a new level of pageviews and never dipped below that level’s threshold again, they were assigned the level, hence the term “sustained pageviews.” If a person hit level 5 (1,000 pageviews), for example, but then dropped below 1,000 pageviews the following month, they would still be a level 4."},{"type":"text","value":"After assigning levels, anyone with 1. a beginning level lower than 4, 2. a level change of more than 4 levels, and 3. less than level 2 in 2015, was included in the final list.
